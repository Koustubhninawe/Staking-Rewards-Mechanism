# Staking Rewards Mechanism

## 📌 Project Description
The **Staking Rewards Mechanism** is a smart contract built on Ethereum using Solidity. It allows users to stake ETH and earn rewards over time. Rewards are calculated based on the amount of ETH staked and the duration of the stake.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To empower decentralized finance (DeFi) by offering a simple, transparent, and secure way for users to earn passive income through ETH staking. The vision is to support a sustainable ecosystem where value accrues to both users and protocol stakeholders.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ **ETH Staking**: Users can stake ETH directly into the contract.
- 🎁 **Reward Generation**: Users earn staking rewards calculated per second based on their staked ETH.
- ⏳ **Claimable Rewards**: Rewards can be claimed at any time without unstaking.

## 🔭 Future Scope
- 💳 Integration with ERC20 token staking.
- 📈 Dynamic reward rates based on market factors or governance votes.
- 🔐 Unstaking mechanism with optional cooldown period.
- 🌍 Multi-chain deployment for scalability.
- 📱 Front-end interface for improved user experience.
